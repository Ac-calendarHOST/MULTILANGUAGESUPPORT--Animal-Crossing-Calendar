Anyone Is allowed to submit changes/fixes to the files. 
Every submission big and small will be reviewed by me to confirm that there hasn't been any changes to other files that haven't been noted in the submission details. 
Once your submitted changes have been accepted they will be used at our website https://sites.google.com/view/animal-crossing-calendar/, without giving credit to you. 
There are exceptions, of course, like when you've single-handedly localized these calendars to your own language you'll get the full credits and we'll link to your GitHub profile on our site!
