# Animal Crossing Calendar
This repository contains all the calendar files of The Animal Crossing Calendar Project.

I made this open-source because of the general positivity inside the Animal Crossing community, and everyone is free to use these files privately and publicly, without the requirement of crediting nor linking to the GitHub page/the https://sites.google.com/view/animal-crossing-calendar/ website. (Of course it's greatly appreciated if you do link back to the project!)

Please read before contributing/using our files our Code of Conduct and Contributing policies in the .github folder.
